I am a highly motivated individual and an experienced IT department head with over 11 years of experience in project management and team leadership. I am dedicated to ensuring that my stakeholders have the right tools to be successful. I am passionate about building teams and a positive culture - developing staff and creating an environment in which people want to collaborate and help each other excel. 

I'm a technology and FOSS enthusiast and enjoy staying abreast of new developments. I'm married with children, most of whom are taller than me, and keep a well-fed menagerie of rescue animals.
